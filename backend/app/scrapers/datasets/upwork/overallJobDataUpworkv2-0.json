    "description": "We are a digital marketing group that specializes in SEO. We acquire warm leads who have shown interest in monthly SEO plans, typically starting at $500. Many of these leads are ready for a conversation, but they often receive calls from other providers as well. We want a Sales Representative who is comfortable calling leads several times a day. You will also send texts and emails. Timing is crucial, so you should be online and ready to engage when a fresh lead appears. Early on, you can expect to work around three hours per day, with growth potential up to six hours if the volume of leads increases. Your main aim is to persuade small companies to commit to a recurring plan for six months. We know that some businesses may be cautious about long-term plans. This is why we offer an accessible monthly rate and highlight the value of consistent SEO work. You will have scripts and initial training to help you. Our team can also join calls with larger prospects until you feel comfortable working solo. Compensation includes a $200 weekly base. Deals at $500 per month earn a 15% commission, paid every two weeks. Larger contracts yield 10% commission. The leads are not cheap, so we are selective. We want someone who can capitalize on every connection and drive revenue. We prefer candidates with proven sales experience. Previous involvement in digital marketing or SEO sales is ideal. You must be persuasive, self-driven, and reliable under pressure. Objection handling should come naturally to you. If that sounds like your style, we would like to speak with you. To apply, please share details on your past sales performance and your availability for daily contact with multiple leads. We are open to candidates who know how to close monthly subscriptions and keep clients satisfied long-term. * Must have a reliable internet connection and computer * Good pair of headsets since you will be calling using our software.",
