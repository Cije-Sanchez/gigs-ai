The bottleneck we are running into is it is just me that is able to Source inventory because there is no Kelly Blue Book, or NADA, for mowers and only I know the market because I've studied it, and specialized in only this for the past 4 years. This is a market that only I know, and need to be able to translate that knowledge to other employees to delegate this task, and allow us to scale further. PS: I know very little about software development. End Goal: I want to have a system built where an employee can plug in what kind of mower they are looking at purchasing for the dealership, it's given specs (Like: Make/Model/Deck Width/Hours/Engine Make/Engine HP, Cosmetic Condition Rating/Expected Problems...etc), and it tell them how much we can afford to pay for it. Please note, this does NOT need to be EXTREMELY sophisticated- I want to get a \"prototype/beta\" going first that only we use in house to purchase inventory within a reasonable budget, then re-fine further from there after its been used. I want to be very clear, we are not in the pursuit of creating a system that is a bandaid fix, we are wanting to compete at a high level, and are in the pursuit of excellence, and high talent. It MUST be a system that employees can interact with, that removes the risk of making a bad purchasing decision, that is easy to train someone on, and that can be easily scaled to more and more purchasing reps in the dealership.","link":"/jobs/Business-Systems-Developer_~021867910753201246788/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs","title":"Business Systems Developer","company":"Unspecified","location":"Remote"},{"id":"/jobs/Video-Editor-Needed-for-Engaging-Content-Creation_~021867859360352391748/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs","experience":"Intermediate","timePosted":"Posted 2 weeks ago","type":"Hourly: $25.00 - $40.00","compensation":"Hourly: $25.00 - $40.00","description":"We are seeking a talented video editor to help us create captivating videos that resonate with our audience.

I need a confident and articulate voice. Here is the transcript for the video: ===================== Avalon's technology is a proprietary software platform for automating factories and manufacturing processes. Combined with robotics, vision, sensors, and AI, the software actively manages the factory and its equipment, integrating everything into one seamless flow. We call our software the Manufacturing Operating System, or M-O-S for short. Here is one example of how Avalon helps manufacturers achieve end-to-end automation. The M-O-S uses computer vision to find the correct piece of raw material. The robot grabs the raw material and places it into the C-N-C machine. With safety checks complete, the M-O-S then remotely starts the CNC machine. Any number of machines can be integrated into the M-O-S for concurrent production. When the CNC machine cycle is complete, the part is cleaned, marked with a laser, inspected with AI vision, and measured by the Coordinate Measurement Machine. Dozens of sensors and cameras throughout the process give the M-O-S feedback that allows it to monitor, manage and optimize every aspect of production. This is just one example of the infinite possibilities of how the Manufacturing Operating System can be rapidly deployed to build fully automation manufacturing. Partner with Avalon to unlock the potential of your manufacturing.","link":"/jobs/Male-Voiceover-Artist-Needed_~021867600503251966881/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs","title":"Male Voiceover Artist Needed","company":"Unspecified","location":"Remote"},{"id":"/jobs/Social-Media-Account-Manager_~021867587013048930581/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs","experience":"Expert","timePosted":"Posted 2 weeks ago","type":"Fixed price","compensation":"Est. budget:\n$60,000.00","description":"About Valiant: ‎ ‎ Valiant is a full-service content creation and digital marketing agency for service businesses in the trading, reselling, sports betting, and e-commerce niches.
