We have a full charge bookkeeper, and only need tax advising, filing preparation, and filing support. Your role would be primarily interfacing with executive leadership and our outsourced bookkeeper for necessary financial reports and information required for tax advising, forms preparation, and filing requirements.

The entity that needs support, a California C-Corp, but was converted from a 501c6 Corporation in 2023, was formed in 2014 through an alliance with other individuals in our niche industry. The industry organization's mission was to provide infrastructure and deal flow to its members. It was initially funded through the purchase of one of the founding members for profit business assets, which had been in business for over 15 years. The purchase of assets from the for profit was conducted via a seller financed asset purchase agreement and note. The note was not paid, and in 2023 the sole remaining member (the original founding member who sold the for profit assets to the non-profit) decided to reorganize as a for profit to comply with IRS rules as it had to begin providing services directly to customers, instead of via its members. The reorganization, settlement & assignment agreement was conducted by our outside counsel, Ryan Woods, Esq., and filed with and accepted by the California Secretary of State. However, the organization's prior accountant failed to properly designate its 2022 990 filing as \"final\", so when counsel filed the IRS \"reclassification\" request, the IRS returned it as unprocessed, and the 2023 returns, although prepared, were not able to be filed as a for profit with the IRS. As such, the first task of the new accountancy should be to make the necessary amendments to the filed 990 return(s), work with counsel to obtain for profit reclassification by the IRS, then review and correct (if required) the drafted 2023 returns, and then file them. The organization, The National Phlebotomy Provider Network, Inc. operates in multiple metro markets in several states and specializes in medical and research specimen collection, processing and delivery services for a variety of customer constituencies. The company is both a B2C and a B2B venture with a very diverse customer constituency. The company utilizes a PEO employment model through ADP, so employer tax liabilities are managed by ADP.
