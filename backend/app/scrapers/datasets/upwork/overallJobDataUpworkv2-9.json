I do not usually do insurance work and do not have the Xactimate software but would like to provide them a quote using it. I need someone familiar with the software to do a detailed estimate and align it with my own idea of what I would charge for the job. I would prefer a fixed price for generating the estimate since it should be fairly straightforward but will entertain hourly. The door and jamb need to be replaced. The main slab is delaminated, and the hinges/ hinge jamb are broken into pieces. The attached pictures are after I repaired what I could. The door is a 3068 RH Fiberglass 6 panel entry door. It has an integrated 12\" sidelight on the left. The total width is 50 3/4\". Above the door is a 12\" tall transom window added to the door in the field and installed as one unit. PVC brick molding on the exterior. 3.5\" casing interior. The house has a brick facade, so it needs extension jambs. Will need paint and calk inside and out. New handle hardware, and electronic deadbolt. I also did an emergency repair Thanksgiving morning to secure the property that I would like to include. Please let me know if this is something you can provide me with and what the cost would be. Thank you John",

    "description": "Backstory I have no prior experience in coding or software development. However, I have a strong understanding of software, AI, and their applications. I excel at grasping how to use and apply software in practical, contextual ways. Long story short, I know how to use and manipulate these areas, I don't know how to build them. By leveraging AI tools and self-teaching, I’ve been able to: Create a Full Codebase: I’ve developed and structured the foundational code for my platform entirely on my own. Build a Local Development Environment: I’ve set up a functional Windows environment to test and validate my code using synthetic data generated by a custom-built synthetic data generator. Run and Test Code: I’ve written and executed Python scripts to generate logs, validate outputs, and ensure functionality. Manage Data Locally: All development work has been done in Notepad++, with files stored locally on my computer. I’ve made significant progress, but I’ve reached a point where I need expert guidance to ensure the project is scalable, efficient, and prepared for transition into a fully functioning product. What I’m Looking For I need a skilled developer, engineer, or technical consultant to help me transition from a self-guided project into a robust, scalable system. Specifically, I need assistance with: 1. Optimizing My Development Workflow Guidance on efficiently using tools I’ve already acquired, such as Docker, Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Visual Studio, and GitHub. Suggestions for additional tools or processes that would streamline my development pipeline. 2. Establishing a Scalable Backend Foundation Reviewing and optimizing my current codebase and internal development processes. Setting up a scalable backend infrastructure that can handle real-world data, users, and operations. Implementing best practices for version control, testing, and deployment pipelines. 3. Preparing for Frontend Development Advising on how to structure the backend to ensure a smooth transition to the frontend UI. Helping me prepare for integration with a React-based UI that includes features like document uploads, conversational AI, and custom widgets for data insights. Ensuring the backend design supports multi-user login and secure data handling for customers. 4. Identifying the Best Path Forward Collaborating on a roadmap to get this project from its current state to an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Recommending the most efficient and scalable architecture for long-term growth. What I’ve Accomplished So Far: Built and tested a synthetic data generator to simulate and validate the platform’s functionality. Created Python scripts to run synthetic data tests and validate outputs. Set up and tested a basic local development environment to verify initial code functionality. Acquired foundational tools like Docker, GCS, and GitHub, though I need help utilizing them effectively. What I Need From You: I’m looking for someone who can: Help me understand and efficiently utilize development tools and workflows. Review, optimize, and build upon the codebase I’ve created. Guide the development of a scalable backend while preparing for the frontend UI. Provide actionable advice to implement a clean, scalable architecture for my platform. Collaborate with me in a way that fosters learning—I want to deeply understand the tools, processes, and decisions behind this project. This is an opportunity to work on a unique project where innovation and foundational thinking are core. If you’re experienced in backend architecture, full-stack development, or scaling software projects, I’d love to collaborate with you to bring this vision to life.",

You connect by bluetooth to your computer, and they can send your moves to live chess games on e.g. lichess.org. I have an iOS companion app for this which I hired someone to work on a while ago, but the project ended up not being completed with some bugs remaining to fix. The way it works is: - you turn on your dgt physical chess board - you log into your laptop, connect it to the board, and start a game - you start the mobile app and can ignore the laptop, and the mobile app shows a game clock and alerts you to moves by your opponent DGT board —laptop—-lichess.org—-mobile app The idea is that this feels more like an in-person game with a chess clock than having to look at the computer. The app is written in swift. I’m a software engineer but am not a swift developer. The code is somewhat messy and has some bugs, eg sometimes the screen randomly turns black due to some race conditions This project: - I’ll send you the source code - you should do Q&A to find and list the bugs and then fix them - (maybe) help shepherd the app through the App Store release process The mobile app uses the lichess read-only API, so there is no need to communicate between the board and the website You don’t actually need the board in order to do this project. You can just start some games in lichess in your browser then connect to the same game from your iPhone or emulator",
