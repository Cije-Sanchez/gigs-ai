I need a confident and articulate voice. Here is the transcript for the video: ===================== Avalon's technology is a proprietary software platform for automating factories and manufacturing processes. Combined with robotics, vision, sensors, and AI, the software actively manages the factory and its equipment, integrating everything into one seamless flow. We call our software the Manufacturing Operating System, or M-O-S for short. Here is one example of how Avalon helps manufacturers achieve end-to-end automation. The M-O-S uses computer vision to find the correct piece of raw material. The robot grabs the raw material and places it into the C-N-C machine. With safety checks complete, the M-O-S then remotely starts the CNC machine. Any number of machines can be integrated into the M-O-S for concurrent production. When the CNC machine cycle is complete, the part is cleaned, marked with a laser, inspected with AI vision, and measured by the Coordinate Measurement Machine. Dozens of sensors and cameras throughout the process give the M-O-S feedback that allows it to monitor, manage and optimize every aspect of production. This is just one example of the infinite possibilities of how the Manufacturing Operating System can be rapidly deployed to build fully automation manufacturing. Partner with Avalon to unlock the potential of your manufacturing.","link":"/jobs/Male-Voiceover-Artist-Needed_~021867600503251966881/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs","title":"Male Voiceover Artist Needed","company":"Unspecified","location":"Remote"},{"id":"/jobs/Social-Media-Account-Manager_~021867587013048930581/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs","experience":"Expert","timePosted":"Posted 2 weeks ago","type":"Fixed price","compensation":"Est. budget: $60,000.00","description":"About Valiant: ‎ ‎ Valiant is a full-service content creation and digital marketing agency for service businesses in the trading, reselling, sports betting, and e-commerce niches.

We have a full charge bookkeeper, and only need tax advising, filing preparation, and filing support. Your role would be primarily interfacing with executive leadership and our outsourced bookkeeper for necessary financial reports and information required for tax advising, forms preparation, and filing requirements.

The entity that needs support, a California C-Corp, but was converted from a 501c6 Corporation in 2023, was formed in 2014 through an alliance with other individuals in our niche industry. The industry organization's mission was to provide infrastructure and deal flow to its members. It was initially funded through the purchase of one of the founding members for profit business assets, which had been in business for over 15 years. The purchase of assets from the for profit was conducted via a seller financed asset purchase agreement and note. The note was not paid, and in 2023 the sole remaining member (the original founding member who sold the for profit assets to the non-profit) decided to reorganize as a for profit to comply with IRS rules as it had to begin providing services directly to customers, instead of via its members. The reorganization, settlement & assignment agreement was conducted by our outside counsel, Ryan Woods, Esq., and filed with and accepted by the California Secretary of State. However, the organization's prior accountant failed to properly designate its 2022 990 filing as \"final\", so when counsel filed the IRS \"reclassification\" request, the IRS returned it as unprocessed, and the 2023 returns, although prepared, were not able to be filed as a for profit with the IRS. As such, the first task of the new accountancy should be to make the necessary amendments to the filed 990 return(s), work with counsel to obtain for profit reclassification by the IRS, then review and correct (if required) the drafted 2023 returns, and then file them. The organization, The National Phlebotomy Provider Network, Inc. operates in multiple metro markets in several states and specializes in medical and research specimen collection, processing and delivery services for a variety of customer constituencies. The company is both a B2C and a B2B venture with a very diverse customer constituency. The company utilizes a PEO employment model through ADP, so employer tax liabilities are managed by ADP.

A client had their front door kicked in and will be going through insurance for the repair. I do not usually do insurance work and do not have the Xactimate software but would like to provide them a quote using it. I need someone familiar with the software to do a detailed estimate and align it with my own idea of what I would charge for the job. I would prefer a fixed price for generating the estimate since it should be fairly straightforward but will entertain hourly. The door and jamb need to be replaced. The main slab is delaminated, and the hinges/ hinge jamb are broken into pieces. The attached pictures are after I repaired what I could. The door is a 3068 RH Fiberglass 6 panel entry door. It has an integrated 12\" sidelight on the left. The total width is 50 3/4\". Above the door is a 12\" tall transom window added to the door in the field and installed as one unit. PVC brick molding on the exterior. 3.5\" casing interior. The house has a brick facade, so it needs extension jambs. Will need paint and calk inside and out.

However, I have a strong understanding of software, AI, and their applications. I excel at grasping how to use and apply software in practical, contextual ways. Long story short, I know how to use and manipulate these areas, I don't know how to build them. By leveraging AI tools and self-teaching, I’ve been able to: Create a Full Codebase: I’ve developed and structured the foundational code for my platform entirely on my own. Build a Local Development Environment: I’ve set up a functional Windows environment to test and validate my code using synthetic data generated by a custom-built synthetic data generator. Run and Test Code: I’ve written and executed Python scripts to generate logs, validate outputs, and ensure functionality. Manage Data Locally: All development work has been done in Notepad++, with files stored locally on my computer. I’ve made significant progress, but I’ve reached a point where I need expert guidance to ensure the project is scalable, efficient, and prepared for transition into a fully functioning product. What I’m Looking For I need a skilled developer, engineer, or technical consultant to help me transition from a self-guided project into a robust, scalable system. Specifically, I need assistance with: 1. Optimizing My Development Workflow Guidance on efficiently using tools I’ve already acquired, such as Docker, Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Visual Studio, and GitHub. Suggestions for additional tools or processes that would streamline my development pipeline. 2. Establishing a Scalable Backend Foundation Reviewing and optimizing my current codebase and internal development processes. Setting up a scalable backend infrastructure that can handle real-world data, users, and operations. Implementing best practices for version control, testing, and deployment pipelines. 3. Preparing for Frontend Development Advising on how to structure the backend to ensure a smooth transition to the frontend UI. Helping me prepare for integration with a React-based UI that includes features like document uploads, conversational AI, and custom widgets for data insights. Ensuring the backend design supports multi-user login and secure data handling for customers. 4. Identifying the Best Path Forward Collaborating on a roadmap to get this project from its current state to an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Recommending the most efficient and scalable architecture for long-term growth. What I’ve Accomplished So Far: Built and tested a synthetic data generator to simulate and validate the platform’s functionality. Created Python scripts to run synthetic data tests and validate outputs. Set up and tested a basic local development environment to verify initial code functionality. Acquired foundational tools like Docker, GCS, and GitHub, though I need help utilizing them effectively. What I Need From You: I’m looking for someone who can: Help me understand and efficiently utilize development tools and workflows. Review, optimize, and build upon the codebase I’ve created. Guide the development of a scalable backend while preparing for the frontend UI. Provide actionable advice to implement a clean, scalable architecture for my platform. Collaborate with me in a way that fosters learning—I want to deeply understand the tools, processes, and decisions behind this project. This is an opportunity to work on a unique project where innovation and foundational thinking are core. If you’re experienced in backend architecture, full-stack development, or scaling software projects, I’d love to collaborate with you to bring this vision to life.","link":"/jobs/Developing-new-span-class-highlight-software-span-need-help_~021863297484727161911/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs","title":"Developing new AI software.

You connect by bluetooth to your computer, and they can send your moves to live chess games on e.g. lichess.org. I have an iOS companion app for this which I hired someone to work on a while ago, but the project ended up not being completed with some bugs remaining to fix. The way it works is: - you turn on your dgt physical chess board - you log into your laptop, connect it to the board, and start a game - you start the mobile app and can ignore the laptop, and the mobile app shows a game clock and alerts you to moves by your opponent DGT board —laptop—-lichess.org—-mobile app The idea is that this feels more like an in-person game with a chess clock than having to look at the computer. The app is written in swift. I’m a software engineer but am not a swift developer. The code is somewhat messy and has some bugs, eg sometimes the screen randomly turns black due to some race conditions This project: - I’ll send you the source code - you should do Q&A to find and list the bugs and then fix them - (maybe) help shepherd the app through the App Store release process The mobile app uses the lichess read-only API, so there is no need to communicate between the board and the website You don’t actually need the board in order to do this project. You can just start some games in lichess in your browser then connect to the same game from your iPhone or emulator","link":"/jobs/Debug-and-polish-lichess-org-iOS-companion-app_~021862001489473005509/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs","title":"Debug and polish a lichess.org iOS companion app","company":"Unspecified","location":"Remote"},{"id":"/jobs/SAS-Instructor-for-our-Client_~021861976205695203745/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs","experience":"Expert","timePosted":"Posted 4 weeks ago","type":"Hourly: $40.00 - $75.00","compensation":"Hourly: $40.00 - $75.00","description":"We are looking for someone who loves using and teaching SAS.
