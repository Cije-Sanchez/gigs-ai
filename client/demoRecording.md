Hello and welcome to the Gigs AI demo.

In this video, I'll show you how the chatbot helps freelancers find software gigs effortlessly.

Let’s get started by typing in a job query.

I’ll ask the chatbot, _"Find me freelance React development jobs."_

The chatbot is now processing my request.

It fetches job listings from multiple platforms like Freelancer.com and Upwork.

Here are the results.

Each job listing includes a title, description, experience level, compensation details, and a link to apply.

You can click on a job for further details

Thank you for watching!
